1. === Set theory

Okay so I will revise all the set concepts from the book's appendix 

- ${1, 2, 3} subset.eq  NN subset.eq RR$
- $phi subset.eq A $
- power set $arrow A = {1, 2}$ then $2^A = {phi, {1}, {2}, {1,2}}$
- $union ->$ Union
- $inter ->$ Intersection
- $ backslash ->$ Not in 
- $ f:A -> B$ represents a function f from A to B mapping elements of A to B 
- $f: A arrow.curve B$ means the function from A to B is "one to one" which means the function is injective
- $f: A â†  B$ means the function from A to B is "onto" which means the function is surjective
- function $f: A -> B$ is bijective if it is both injective and surjective, for each $b in B$ there is $a in A$ such that $f(a) = b$
- equivalence relation $~$
  - reflexive: $ x ~ y$
  - symmetric: $ x ~ y$
  - transitive: $ x ~ y "and" y ~ z "then" y ~ z$
\
that was all about set theory 


2. === Proof writing

I will update this section later on, because i dont know about this now that much

 == 1. Groups 

A group is a pair $ G = (G, star)$ consisting of a set of elements G, and a binary operation $star$ on G, such that: 
\

- G has an identity element $1_G$, with property that 
$
  1_G star g = g star 1_G, "where" g in G
$
- The operation is associative, $(a star b) star c = a star (b star c)$
- Each element $g in G$ has an inverse, that is, an element $ h in G$ such that 
$
  g star h = h star g = 1_G
$, the above line means $->$ $"for every a" in G, "there is an" a^-1 in G "such that" a dot a^-1 = 1_G$

It is not required that $star$ is commutative, so we say that the group is *non-abelian*, if the operation is commutative then the group is *abelian*
\

The main for properties of group are 
  + Closure 
  + Associativity 
  + Identity 
  + Inverses 

Some non-abelian examples: 
+ General Linear Group - $("GL"_n (RR), times)$
+ Special Linear Group - $("SL"_n (RR), times)$
+ Symmetric Group - $("S"_n, circle)$
+ Dihedral Group of order 2n - $D_"2n"$
