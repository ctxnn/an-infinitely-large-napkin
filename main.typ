1. === Set theory

Okay so I will revise all the set concepts from the book's appendix 

- ${1, 2, 3} subset.eq  NN subset.eq RR$
- $phi subset.eq A $
- power set $arrow A = {1, 2}$ then $2^A = {phi, {1}, {2}, {1,2}}$
- $union ->$ Union
- $inter ->$ Intersection
- $ backslash ->$ Not in 
- $ f:A -> B$ represents a function f from A to B mapping elements of A to B 
- $f: A arrow.curve B$ means the function from A to B is "one to one" which means the function is injective
- $f: A â†  B$ means the function from A to B is "onto" which means the function is surjective
- function $f: A -> B$ is bijective if it is both injective and surjective, for each $b in B$ there is $a in A$ such that $f(a) = b$
- equivalence relation $~$
  - reflexive: $ x ~ y$
  - symmetric: $ x ~ y$
  - transitive: $ x ~ y "and" y ~ z "then" y ~ z$
\
that was all about set theory 


2. === Proof writing

I will update this section later on, because i dont know about this now that much

1. == Groups 

A group is a pair $ G = (G, star)$ consisting of a set of elements G, and a binary operation $star$ on G, such that: 
\

- G has an identity element
